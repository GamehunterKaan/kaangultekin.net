# PowerShell Projects â€” Catalog, Research & Defensive Guidance

## PowerShell-focused tooling & research  
A defender- and researcher-oriented summary of PowerShell projects I maintain or collect. This page outlines project goals, conceptual architecture, defensive implications, and how teams can responsibly use the work for detection tuning and purple-team exercises. No operational exploit code or instructions are provided.

## Executive summary

PowerShell is a built-in automation platform widely used by administrators, defenders, and researchers. The projects summarized here span utilities, network/recon tooling, and focused research. One significant internal research area is a fileless, in-memory PowerShell research effort. That work is intended for defensive testing, detection development, and coordinated purple-team validation; it is available under controlled conditions and is not published as a weaponized artifact.

- **Utilities:** File discovery, log helpers, and small admin aids used for incident triage.  
- **Network & Recon:** Lightweight discovery and mapping tools for controlled lab recon.  
- **Research (internal/private):** Focused work on detection gaps and memory-resident behaviors; access is coordinated.  
- **Automation & Orchestration:** Scripts to provision labs, collect telemetry, and run repeatable tests.

## Project summaries (short, 2â€“3 lines each)

### ðŸ”¹ PowerShell-File-Search  
A fast PowerShell utility for locating and filtering files across endpointsâ€”useful for incident triage and targeted artifact collection.  
**Use:** IR and admin helper. Â· **Link:** `https://github.com/GamehunterKaan/PowerShell-File-Search`

### ðŸ”¹ PowerShell-Network-Scanner  
Lightweight discovery tool to find live hosts and enumerate basic services in test environments.  
**Use:** Recon and mapping in controlled exercises. Â· **Link:** `https://github.com/GamehunterKaan/PowerShell-Network-Scanner`

### ðŸ”¹ Fileless PowerShell Research *(internal / access-controlled)*  
A defensive research program that examines in-memory (fileless) behaviors and related telemetry. The research focuses on detection hypotheses, SOC playbooks, and sanitized testcases for purple-team validation. Access is granted only under written authorization and defined scope.  
**Use:** Detection development, SOC training, and internal validation. Â·

## Research: fileless PowerShell (internal, defensive)

> **Important:** The content below is descriptive and defensive. It intentionally excludes operational details and implementation techniques.

### Purpose & scope
The internal fileless research is intended to help defenders understand how memory-resident techniques manifest in telemetry and to provide sanitized testcases that improve detection coverage and incident response playbooks. It is **not** publicly released as an exploit toolkit.

### Research goals (defensive)
- Surface observable telemetry patterns that distinguish suspicious in-memory activity from benign administration tasks.  
- Produce detection hypotheses, telemetry requirements, and SOC playbooks.  
- Create sanitized, reproducible testcases for purple-team validation and EDR tuning.

  Tune --> Validate[Purple-Team Validation]
</div>

### Defensive guidance & constraints
- Ensure EDR/endpoint tooling collects and retains sufficient process and memory-related telemetry to correlate transient behaviors.  
- Correlate parent/child process chains, command-line context, and network activity with suspicious in-memory indicators.  
- Use sanitized testcases from the internal research to validate detection precision and SOC playbooks in isolated environments.  
- Access to raw artifacts or testcases is granted only under coordinated, written authorization and a defined scope.

## Detection hypotheses & SOC playbook snippets (conceptual)

> These are high-level hypotheses to be tested in authorized labs and converted into telemetry queries by your SOC/IR team.

1. **Attach-to-Action Spike:** Correlate recent automation/device events with rapid, automated process or network activity within a brief time window.  
2. **Transient In-memory Anomalies:** Memory-only indicators in otherwise common processes (with no corresponding disk artifacts) should trigger elevated review.  
3. **Unexpected Egress after Automation:** Outbound connections initiated immediately after scripted automation events warrant containment and investigation.

**SOC checklist (conceptual):**
- Collect device attach events, process creation, parent/child relationships, and network flows.  
- Enrich telemetry with host role, environment (lab/production), and user context.  
- For high-confidence incidents, isolate the host (authorized process), preserve telemetry artifacts, and follow documented incident response steps.

---

## Safe testing & ethical practice (short checklist)

- Test **only** in isolated labs (air-gapped or strongly segmented).  
- Obtain written authorization and document scope, objectives, and rollback steps.  
- Sanitize any artifacts intended for external sharing and always include defensive guidance.  
- Coordinate disclosure if research affects third-party products or services.

---

## Access & coordination

Because the internal fileless research involves sensitive techniques, raw artifacts and testcases are available **only** under coordinated engagements with written authorization and defined scope. If you are a researcher, SOC team, or vendor seeking access for defensive validation, contact the project owner to arrange a controlled engagement.

---

## Next steps & options

If desired, I can:
- Export the Mermaid diagrams to SVG/PNG for slide decks and training materials.  
- Draft an access-controlled README template for the internal research repo that includes safe-testing checklists and an access request process.  
- Produce one-page defensive summaries (sanitized telemetry examples) for each public repo.
