# üöÄ Introduction

**CompanyEnum** is a powerful Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) framework designed to aggregate comprehensive data about companies from a multitude of public sources. For security researchers, corporate investigators, and market analysts, it automates the tedious process of data collection, providing a unified view of a company's profile.

From corporate structure and financials to the technology stack and security posture, CompanyEnum gathers and presents information in a clean, structured format, allowing you to focus on analysis rather than data hunting.

## üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Use Cases

While CompanyEnum is an OSINT tool, defenders can use it to:

- **Map External Footprint**: Discover domains, subdomains, and public assets that may have been forgotten or are improperly configured.
- **Identify Information Leakage**: Find sensitive metadata in public records, such as WHOIS data that isn't properly redacted or developer emails in code repositories.
- **Baseline Security Posture**: Get an attacker's-eye view of your organization's security headers, SSL/TLS configurations, and publicly exposed technologies.
- **Audit for Brand Impersonation**: Monitor for newly registered domains that resemble your brand, which could be used for phishing attacks.
