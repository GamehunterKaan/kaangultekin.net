## 🧑‍💻 Who I Am

I’m **Kaan Gültekin** — a software engineering student, software developer, and cybersecurity researcher.  
I specialize in automation-first tooling, offensive security research, and open-source projects that support both red-team testing and defensive security awareness.

---

## 🛠 Projects

### 🔹 AutoPWN-Suite  
My flagship project — a comprehensive **offensive automation framework** that streamlines post-exploitation and red-team workflows. It has gained significant recognition across the security community and continues to be one of my most impactful contributions.

### 🔹 PowerShell Fileless Malware (Research Project)  
A **private research-oriented proof-of-concept** exploring **fileless PowerShell techniques**. The project demonstrates in-memory execution and advanced evasion strategies, with a focus on helping defenders test and strengthen detection capabilities.  
- Strictly built for **academic and defensive purposes**.  
- Includes features like in memory .dll execution, spyware tools, automatic spreading features etc.  
- Serves as a study case for modern anti-virus/EDR evasion research.  

### 🔹 Other Open-Source Tools  
- [**PowerShell-File-Search**](https://github.com/GamehunterKaan/PowerShell-File-Search) — fast file discovery & extraction.  
- [**BadUSB-Browser**](https://github.com/GamehunterKaan/BadUSB-Browser), [**BadUSB-Meterpreter**](https://github.com/GamehunterKaan/BadUSB-Meterpreter), [**VBSBadUSB**](https://github.com/GamehunterKaan/VBSBadUSB) — USB attack surface PoCs.  
- [**SharpCam**](https://github.com/GamehunterKaan/SharpCam), **Plog**, **Chexport**, and other utilities.

## 🔬 Research

My research focuses on bridging **offensive innovation** with **defensive application**.  
Instead of building exploits for exploitation’s sake, I design projects that highlight blind spots in detection, help blue teams test defenses, and provide insights for security education.

### Key Research Areas
- **Fileless & In-Memory Attacks**  
  Created a  PowerShell fileless framework PoC, analyzing how adversaries abuse memory-only execution and providing defenders with guidance on detection strategies.  

- **USB Attack Vectors**  
  Designed multiple BadUSB-style research projects to showcase real-world risks of malicious peripherals and promote hardware-level security awareness.  

- **Automation & Post-Exploitation**  
  Through AutoPWN-Suite and related tooling, I study how offensive automation affects red-team efficiency, and how defenders can anticipate automation-based attack patterns.  

- **Disclosure & Collaboration**  
  Actively participate in bug bounty programs and responsible disclosure (e.g., Discord Security recognition).
