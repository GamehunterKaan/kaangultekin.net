# <i class="fas fa-flask"></i> Research
{: .glow-text .pulse .fade-in }

My research focuses on bridging **offensive innovation** with **defensive application**.  
Instead of building exploits for exploitation’s sake, I design projects that highlight blind spots in detection, help blue teams test defenses, and provide insights for security education.
