# 🧑‍💻 Who I Am

I’m **Kaan Gültekin** — a software engineering student, software developer, and cybersecurity researcher.  
I specialize in automation-first tooling, offensive security research, and open-source projects that support both red-team testing and defensive security awareness.

# 🛠 Projects

## 🔹 Offensive Frameworks & Red Team Automation
### **AutoPWN-Suite**  
  A **comprehensive offensive automation framework** that streamlines post-exploitation and red-team workflows. AutoPWN-Suite has gained wide recognition across the security community and remains one of my most impactful open-source contributions.  
  - Automates common offensive tasks into a unified workflow.  
  - Reduces time for red teams and security researchers.  
  - Widely adopted and cited within the infosec community.

## 🔹 USB / Hardware Exploitation
### **BadUSB-Browser**  
  A **BadUSB proof-of-concept** demonstrating how malicious USB devices can interact with browsers to execute payloads.  
  - Explores **USB attack vectors** against browser contexts.  
  - Helps defenders understand **peripheral-based threats**.  
  - For **lab testing and awareness training** only.

### **BadUSB-Meterpreter**  
  A **USB exploitation PoC** integrating BadUSB techniques with Meterpreter sessions.  
  - Demonstrates **cross-vector attack surfaces**.  
  - Serves as a **red-team training scenario**.  
  - Strictly research-oriented with clear defensive lessons.

### **VBSBadUSB**  
  A **VBScript-based BadUSB research project**, showing how lightweight scripting can still be leveraged for malicious USB behaviors.  
  - Small-scale **scripting PoC** for awareness.  
  - Highlights that **legacy scripting languages** remain exploitable.  
  - Designed for **educational and defensive purposes**.

## 🔹 PowerShell Tools & Research
### **PowerShell-File-Search**  
  A **PowerShell utility** for fast file discovery across systems.  
  - Locates files based on **patterns and parameters**.  
  - Simplifies **data discovery in Windows environments**.  
  - Lightweight, efficient, and open-source.

### **PowerShell Fileless Malware (Research Project)** *(not public)*  
  A **private proof-of-concept** exploring **fileless PowerShell techniques** to study in-memory execution and evasion strategies. This work is **not publicly released** and is used for controlled defensive and academic research.  
  - Demonstrates modern **fileless attack patterns** in controlled environments.  
  - Used to develop **detection and mitigation strategies**.  
  - Intended for **internal/academic defensive research only**.

---

## 🔹 Recon & OSINT Tools
### **CompanyEnum**  
  An **OSINT reconnaissance tool** for gathering open-source information about organizations. CompanyEnum automates company profiling and delivers results through a clean **Web UI**, making it efficient for both recon and defensive validation.  
  - Aggregates scattered **public company data** into one view.  
  - Speeds up reconnaissance with a **visual interface**.  
  - Useful for **red-team recon** and **blue-team validation**.

# 🔬 Research

My research focuses on bridging **offensive innovation** with **defensive application**.  
Instead of building exploits for exploitation’s sake, I design projects that highlight blind spots in detection, help blue teams test defenses, and provide insights for security education.

## Key Research Areas
- **Fileless & In-Memory Attacks**  
  Created a  PowerShell fileless framework PoC, analyzing how adversaries abuse memory-only execution and providing defenders with guidance on detection strategies.  

- **USB Attack Vectors**  
  Designed multiple BadUSB-style research projects to showcase real-world risks of malicious peripherals and promote hardware-level security awareness.  

- **Automation & Post-Exploitation**  
  Through AutoPWN-Suite and related tooling, I study how offensive automation affects red-team efficiency, and how defenders can anticipate automation-based attack patterns.  

- **Disclosure & Collaboration**  
  Actively participate in bug bounty programs and responsible disclosure (e.g., Discord Security recognition).
